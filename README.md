# Shadowverse World's Beyond : Deck winrate data

Small project to train Python basics and workflow, and manipulation .json files.

## Goal

Build a CLI based app (might use a tkinter based UI later) to register new decks, update existing deck stats at global level but also against specific matchups.

## MVP

- Testing with a single deck (Forest class)
- Direct input via CLI with different commands (add deck, add match, check stats)
- output to .json file

# Usage 

The MVP only supports Forest deck and a single input at a time
